#-- Created on May 6th 2021 (re-calibrate setup after recent changes: re-machined vacuum plate with updated HV tail slot)

# Sensor    Ref-Point = corner of fiducial marker measured with Pattern Recognition
# Spacer    Ref-Point = corner of spacer in correspondence with the Sensor Ref-Point
# Baseplate Ref-Point = corner [...]
# NB: 'edge' <-> corner
